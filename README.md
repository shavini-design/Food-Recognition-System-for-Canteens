# Food-Recognition-System-for-Canteens
This is a web based point of sales application to bill bakery food up to 4 items per time, using machine learning. 
Here XAMPP is used as the local server and MariaDB is used to create database tables. 
This is designed using Django framework mainly and html, python, CSS, JavaScript and SQL language for data rendering. 
MVT (Model-View-Template) architecture is followed throughout the project as it is promoted by Django framework.
OpenCV is used in food recognition process.
This is developed with a unique food capturing and scannnig machine designed by solely myself. So this is related to IOT platforms.
This is completed by me for individual research project as a final year software engineering undergraduate.
I hope you will happy to see this code files as a beginner work of my undergraduate years. Thank you!
